pytipsy: low(ish) level tools to help out with GASOLINE and TIPSY
=================================================================

pytipsy is a couple of handy helpers for working with GASOLINE.
The module includes two functions and a special class:

* rtipsy: a rewrite of James Wadsley's IDL script for reading raw tipsy files
* wtipsy: the same as above, but for writing
* gaslog: a class for working with the gasoline log outputs.
